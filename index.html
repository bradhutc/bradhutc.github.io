                    <p>Hello! My name is Bradley Hutchinson, and I am a third-year undergraduate pursuing three B.S's in Astronomy/Astrophysics, Mathematics, and Physics at Indiana University. With a strong desire to further our understanding of the universe, I have been involved in research since my first year, being an active contributor in projects involving machine learning, multiband stellar photometry, globular clusters, next-to-leading order corrections on a first ATLAS measurement, and beyond the Standard Model (BSM) searches.</p>
                    <p>My research in astronomy includes working with Dr. Catherine A. Pilachowski and Dr. Christian I. Johnson on new ways to easier analyze multiband photometry of stars in large-scale surveys using unsupervised machine learning (UML), and studying biases in the determination of relaxation time of globular clusters with Dr. Francisco I. Aros. In addition, I am an undergraduate researcher under the supervision of Dr. Sabine Lammers within the ATLAS Experiment at CERN, with my first project being electroweak (EW) corrections on vector boson scattering, and now focusing on a vector-like quarks search, building deep-learning models to distinguish signal from background processes and to reconstruct particle masses from final state observables.</p>
